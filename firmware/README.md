This [firmware image](tasmota4MB.bin) can be downloaded and then uploaded to your device, via OTA. 

For the interested, here follows some information about the creation process for this image.

I am using the TasmoCompiler tool. This is a web based tool and I have it running in a docker container. In case you have access to a docker environment, the setup process is very easy (my startscript for the container is available)
