This [firmware image](tasmota4MB.bin) can be downloaded and then uploaded to your device, via OTA. 

For the interested, here follows some information about the creation process for this image.

I am using the TasmoCompiler tool. This is a web based tool and I have it running in a docker container. In case you have access to a docker environment, the setup process is very easy (my [startscript](docker-start.sh) for the container is available). Please consult the [TasmoCompiler website](https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler) for further info and other installation alternatives.

Here follows a screenshot for each step of the firmware image creation process. It should be made clear about all options selected for the created image.
